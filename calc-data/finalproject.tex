\begin{abstract}
This is an analysis of data taken from the GOSH Flight Path Predictor\textsuperscript{TM}.
Four separate sets of data were analyzed:
temperature vs. density, wind velocity vs. pressure, wind angle vs. wind velocity, and wind velocity vs. altitude.
Each is discussed in more depth in subsequent parts.
\end{abstract}

\part{Wind Velocity vs. Altitude}
This data seems to have two points that are of great interest.
