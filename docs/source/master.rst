master.bat
================

master.bat (located in the root of the Project CODENAME repository) can
quickly process a sensor data text file in a properly-configured version of the repository.

Simply input the relative path of the .txt file when asked for it and the code should properly
run through the decoder and the data vis before moving the outputs to the
OUTPUTS folder under a folder with the same name.

A shell script version of this piece of code needs to be created.
