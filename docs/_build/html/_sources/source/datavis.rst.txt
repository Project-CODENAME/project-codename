Data Visualization Tools
==========================
The data visualization tools was built with PyCharm Professional.

Our data visualization tools run on Python 3 with
the packages of  matplotlib, plotly, pandas, and numpy.
All of these packages can be installed with
``pip install`` (or ``python -m pip install`` for Windows users).
It generates .png pictures (which are definitely not ranged upon the data, and so should not be used)
and interactive .html plots of the data which include various actions that
allow you to easily see and interact with the data.

To run this program, simply use ``python viscode.py`` while data.csv (from the decoder) is within the Data Vis photo. 

This does not quite visualize all the data, and should be
expanded to generate all graphs.
