\section{4th Annual High Altitude Challenge}
This document is an overview of a design concept submitted to the
4th Annual High Altitude Challenge at Stevens High School. The competition
challenged over 30 teams to submit a grant proposal for a high altitude
balloon payload. This payload will be attached to a helium propelled weather balloon and lifted off into the atmosphere, to a projected height of over 120,000ft.  The payload must then return to the ground safely (via parachute.)  The exact function of the payload is typically left up to individual teams, but general guidelines include taking sensor readings of the atmosphere and/or aerial photographs.  The more specific guidelines put in place for this year's competition are described below:

The payload is required to\dots
\begin{enumerate}
\item Adhere to all federal, state, and local laws and comply with FCC and
FAA regulations.
\item Communicate with the ground at all times via APRS radio.\label{req:APRS}
\item Include a redundant means of locating the payload on the ground, should the primary method fail.\label{req:redundant_location}
\item Return photographic evidence of the entire flight, including the balloon
burst.
\item Measure external temperature and pressure AND monitor internal temperature
and pressure at all times during the flight\label{req:sensors} of the High Altitude Challenge.
\item Survive 10-g accelerations in every orientation.
\item Be Reusable.
\item Measure 3-Axis Acceleration.\label{req:accelerometer}
\item Weigh LESS THAN 250 grams (including parachute and lines).
\item Minimize instabilities (specifically spinning.)\label{req:spinning}
\end{enumerate}
The payload designed by Team CODENAME won first place in the competition
and was awarded a \$3,000 grant to build the payload according to the specifications described in this document.

\part{Path Prediction, Tracking, and Recovery}
\label{ground-station}

\section{Flight Path Prediction}
\label{sec:path-prediction}

The target landing area for the payload was the Badlands National Park.  Project CODENAME utilized a two-part method for predicting the path of the balloon.  Following the opening of the launch window on April 1, possible flight paths were run via the HabHub Predictive Engine\cite{HabHub} on a weekly basis in search of a flight path that looked promising.  See Figure \ref{fig:hahub} for an example of this.  If a given date looked promising, CODENAME moved to the more accurate Gosh Flight Path Predictor (which can only predict three days into the future.)  This program was designed through the collaborative efforts of Gabriel Spahn and Joshua Morin-Baxter, based on work done by Penny Zabel.  The GOSH Flight Path predictor allows an hour-by-hour analysis of every possible flight path within a three day window.  See Figure \ref{fig:GOSH} for a better idea of what this means.

%TODO add a section devoted to explaining the GOSH Flight Path Predictor

Both flight path predictors rely on the following information to provide accurate predictions.

\begin{description}
\item [Launch Point (lat long)] 44.075604, -103.286696 (Stevens High School Football Field)
\item [Launch Point Elevation] 1043.2 m or 3422.5 feet
\item [Burst Altitude] 39060m*
\item [Ascent Rate] $3.83 \si{\frac{m}{s}}$*
\item [Descent Rate] $4.5658\si{\frac{m}{s}}$*
\end{description}
*Determined by helium volume and balloon size, positive lift, and parachute size, respectively.  These items are discussed in depth in Part \ref{part:external}.

\newpage

Project CODENAME has developed two important operational scripts: one runs on the S4 Chipset and is essentially a highly persistent app that commandeers the phone's onboard sensors and camera; the second is a modification to the source code shipped with the Tracksoar APRS Tracking device.  These are discussed in greater detail within subsequent sections.


\section{Samsung Galaxy S4 Chipset}

This is the primary computing component of the payload. It consists of a computer board taken from a Samsung Galaxy S4 phone, reprogrammed to suit the needs of the project. See Figure \ref{fig:chipset-alone}.  The chipset contains eight integrated sensors, including a RGB light sensor, a magnetometer, a gravimeter, an accelerometer, thermometer, barometer, hygrometer, and sensors to measure orientation vectors. Since all of these sensors are built into the chipset, they add no extra weight and write data directly to the phone's memory where it can be stored for later retrieval. Project CODENAME has further configured the chipset to write data to an external SD card as a failsafe.

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{centering}
\includegraphics[scale=0.3]{./images/chipset-alone}
\par\end{centering}
\label{fig:chipset-alone}
\caption{Chipset alone; note that the RGB light sensor and LED indicator are missing as they were lost on impact}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Cameras} In addition to the sensors enumerated above, the two chipset cameras (the front-facing and rear-facing cameras of the S4 phone, 2MP and 13MP respectively) provide two unique angles from which the payload can take photographs for the duration of the flight. Due to last-minute technical limitations, Project CODENAME flew with only the 13MP rear camera operational.  Despite this setback, the payload collected nearly 349 high-quality photographs between the ground and around 100,000 feet.  Several have been included in this report, but the entire collection can be found at the following web address: \\ \texttt{https://goo.gl/photos/KxeScd8xWUMMQ9vt6}
%TODO figure out the best way to make these photographs available to readers

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{centering}
\includegraphics[scale=0.9]{./images/rear4}
\par\end{centering}
\caption{Photograph taken by rear camera on Galaxy S4 Chipset}
\end{figure}
%TODO add the four others already in the image folder
%TODO if at all possible, indicate the various altitudes at which the photographs were taken in the album

\textbf{Power Supply and Battery Life} The Galaxy Samsung S4 Phone ships with a 2600mAh battery.  As projections suggested this would only provide around three hours of reliable operation, Project CODENAME replaced the factory battery with an extended lithium-ion battery, doubling the capacity to 5600mAh.  During ground tests, the chipset ran between 6 and 8 hours on a single charge.  During the flight, the chipset powered down with 40\% battery remaining.  While the cause is not entirely understood, it is believed to be related to overheating. (See Temperature below).

\textbf{Weight Reduction} Due to the weight of the screen, Project CODENAME chose to remove the chipset entirely from the rest of the phone.  Both the chipset and the battery were secured on the plastic phone back designed for use with the extended battery.  The plastic phone back was perforated to increase heat dissipation and reduce weight.  All other phone components were removed.

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{centering}
\includegraphics[scale=0.2]{./images/chipset-tray}
\par\end{centering}
\label{chipset-tray}
\caption{Plastic phone back modified to house the chipset and battery}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Temperature} The biggest hurdle encountered concerning the chipset was heat dissipation.  The temperature at which the chipset was operating had a big impact on its battery life, and to examine this, it was allowed to expend one full battery charge at room temperature, one in a refrigerator, and one in a freezer.  The results yielded insights into the impact of temperature on battery life.
%TODO ALAN discuss what these insights were, including figures and graphs

When running at room temperature (and often when refrigerated as well) the chipset had a tendency to overheat to the point of shutting down.  This issue stemmed from the excessive camera use required by the program and was exacerbated by the larger battery and plastic tray.  To solve this, Project CODENAMe made a number of minor adjustments to the programming to maintain optimal temperature conditions.
%TODO ALAN explain how the program maintains optimal temperatures.  Also feel free to rewrite anything I said about the heat managing program so far, and add your name in if you want since it was your baby

\end{figure}

%TODO include all the images for the chipset
%TODO ALAN add table of chipset data to appendices


\section{Tracksoar APRS Transmitter}

The Tracksoar APRS transmitter is the second computing component aboard the payload. While it is equipped with several sensors (specifically a GPS sensor along with external temperature, pressure, and humidity) it primarily serves as the point of contact between the payload and the ground. The transmitter transmits the payload's location (and its sensor readings) on the 2 meter band, where it is picked up by the APRS relay system and can be received anywhere in the state of South Dakota, as per requirement \ref{req:APRS} of the HAC. This allows for constant monitoring of the payload's position and exact conditions. The Tracksoar ships with a three AA battery power source purported to provide 12 hours of continual transmission, but Project CODENAME chose to upgrade to a high-density lipo battery.  This allowed the Tracksoar to operate for over 40 hours during ground testing.

The Tracksoar that accompanied the payload on the balloon flight was actually the third Tracksoar device Project CODENAME worked with.  The first device shipped to CODENAME had an undetermined error that finally resulted in a critical failure of the entire device.  The second device had the same error, which was finally determined to be a wiring issue on the motherboard.  Finally, a third Tracksoar was acquired that did NOT have this issue.  However, programming on this third computing component revealed a critical flaw in the official source code that resulted in the Tracksoar freezing and becoming inoperable after random intervals of time.  Project CODENAME fixed this error by leveraging the existing watchdog timer on the ATMEGA328P.  The working version of the source code is available on Project CODENAME's Github.
%TODO ALAN change this in any way you see fit

Following the changes to the source code, the Tracksoar performed admirably for the entire flight and even continued transmitting after it was recovered on the ground.


%TODO add table of Tracksoar data to appendices
%TODO Discuss antenna
%TODO discuss how the Tracksoar fared in the flight

\section{Sensors}

%TODO clean this up so it accurately reflects the sensor data we collected
%TODO add graphs of sensor data that combines data from both the chipset AND the Tracksoar
%TODO possibly discuss any notable pieces of data, such as confirming the jet stream etc.

While the High Altitude Challenge requires only four sensors (internal
and external temperature and pressure), the project CODENAME payload
is equipped with a total of 16 distinct sensors distributed among
the two computing components described above. This section examines
the purpose of each sensor or sensor group.  In this discussion they have been loosely grouped into two categories
as shown below\@.

\subsubsection*{Category 1}

Sensors relating to the management and operation of the payload itself.
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{GPS (latitude and longitude) and altimeter: }These sensors
provide the payload's exact position. This is the data used by the
ground station to track the payload's flight path.
\item \textbf{Accelerometer and orientation vector sensors: }These sensors
allow the payload to determine its exact orientation at all times;
the data can be used to recreate how the payload is turning or spinning
in the air. It also improves location accuracy as it can be used to
measure payload flight trajectory over short distances between GPS
measurements.  The accelerometer also meets requirement \ref{req:accelerometer} of the High Altitude Challenge.
\item \textbf{Internal thermometer, internal barometer and internal hygrometer:}
Measures the ambient temperature, pressure, and humidity, respectively,
on the inside of the payload. This provides important data on the
internal operating conditions of the payload, as per requirement~\ref{req:sensors} of the High Altitude Challenge.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Category 2}

Sensors relating to to the capture of unique scientific data.
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{External thermometer, external barometer, and external hygrometer:
}Measures the ambient temperature, pressure, and humidity, respectively,
on the outside of the payload. This data provides information on atmospheric
conditions around the payload,~\ref{req:sensors} of the High Altitude Challenge.
\item \textbf{Gravimeter: }Measures strength of earth's gravitational field
at a given altitude.
\item \textbf{Magnetometer: }Measures strength of earth's magnetic field
at a given altitude.
\end{itemize}

\part{External}
\label{part:external}

\section{Housing}

The payload shape was inspired by the famous Soyuz capsule, first employed by the USSR and NASA as early as 1960 but still in use today.  This shape is ideal for stabilizing a craft as it reenters the atmosphere (requirement number \ref{req:spinning} of the High Altitude Challenge requirements.)  This proved particularly relevant for the payload as the parachute did not deploy.

%TODO confirm this is actually Foamular 150
The housing material is Foamular 150.  This is an insulating foam that is ideal for keeping the payload within operating temperature conditions, without adding unnecessary weight.

\begin{figure}[H]

\par\end{centering}
\caption{Rendering of Payload External Shape}

\end{figure}

%TODO add an explanation of how exactly Nate machined the payload to be the beautiful work of art it is

\newpage
\section{Balloon and Helium}
Past teams in the High Altitude Challenge have typically used 1200 gram weather balloons; however, Project CODENAME has selected a larger 1500 gram weather balloon.  This increase in size will allow the payload to travel higher in a shorter amount of time, though it will increase the helium demand.  See Table \ref{balloon_size} in the appendix for a comparison of the standard weather balloon sizes\cite{balloon-performance-calculator}.

Simulations run on the GOSH Flight predictor (discussed in Part \ref{ground-station}). determined that the  amount of positive lift needed for the payload to achieve the best possible combination of flight time and burst altitude was approximately 160 grams.  A dummy payload was created weighing 410 grams (250+160); this was attached to the balloon as it was filled, and fill stopped when the balloon became buoyant.  Sponsor A\&B Welding of Rapid City donated the helium required for the flight.

Given any one type of balloon, the exact amount of helium that is needed comes from a consideration of two factors: burst altitude and flight time.  As more helium is added to the balloon, flight time decreases (which is an important consideration for the battery life of the payload) but burst altitude also decreases. Conversely, less helium ensures a higher burst altitude, but a longer flight time.  These relationships are demonstrated in Figure~\ref{fig:heliumgraph}.

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{centering}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{./graphs/heliumgraph}
\par\end{centering}
\caption{Graphs of ascent time and burst altitude, respectively, versus amount of helium.}
\label{fig:heliumgraph}
\end{figure}


\newpage
\section{Parachute}
\label{sec:parachute}
The following equation\cite{parachute-equation} is often used to calculate the necessary parachute diameter to land a payload at a given speed.
\begin{equation}
d = \sqrt{\frac{8mg}{\pi rC_dv^2}}
\label{eq:parachute_original}
\end{equation}
Where
\begin{description}
  \item $d$ = diameter of the parachute
  \item $m$ = mass of payload
  \item $r$ = $1.22\si{\frac{kg}{m^3}}$ (density of air)
  \item $C_d$ = 1.5 (the drag coefficient for a true, dome shaped parachute)
  \item v = velocity at time of impact with ground
\end{description}

Research\cite{3to5} suggested that payload's impact-resistant shell would allow it to land at speeds between 3\si{\frac{m}{s}} and $5\si{\frac{m}{s}}$ without sustaining major internal damage.  Solving equation \ref{eq:parachute_original} for each of these velocities provides the range for the ideal diameter of Project CODENAME's parachute (assuming mass to be 250 grams).

\begin{equation}
d = \sqrt{\frac{8\cdot 0.25\si{kg} \cdot 9.81\si{\frac{m}{s}}}{\pi \cdot 1.22\si{\frac{kg}{m^3}}\cdot1.5 \cdot 3^2}}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
d = 0.616\si{m}
\label{d_upper}
\end{equation}


\begin{equation}
d = \sqrt{\frac{8\cdot 0.25\si{kg} \cdot 9.81\si{\frac{m}{s}}}{\pi \cdot 1.22\si{\frac{kg}{m^3}}\cdot1.5 \cdot 5^2}}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
d = 0.369\si{m}
\label{d_lower}
\end{equation}

  Equations \ref{d_lower} and \ref{d_upper} suggest that the optimum parachute diameter is between 0.369m and 0.616m. Based on these figures, Project CODENAME selected the TARC-16 Parachute to accompany the payload into orbit.  This parachute has a diameter of 0.4064m (16"), which provides a descent rate of $4.5658\si{\frac{m}{s}}$ according to equation
\ref{eq:parachute_original}.

The parachute was tested in a droptest from the Stevens High School auditorium catwalk.  A dummy payload was fastened to the parachute (approximating the weight of the actual payload) and it was filmed as it fell 34 feet to the ground.  The freeware program Tracker (available at http://physlets.org/tracker/) was used to analyze the distance the parachute fell with respect to time over the last 12 feet of the fall.  The resulting position-time graph is displayed in Figure \ref{fig:parachute-derivative}.  Since the slope is a constant 1.426\si{\frac{m}{s}}, this was taken to be the terminal velocity of the parachute. % figure out what went wrong here

Unfortunately, during the flight of Project CODENAME, the parachute never deployed.  This was a result of the remnants of the balloon becoming entangled in the lines of the parachute on its descent.  Luckily, the payload landed entirely intact with only minor external damage.

%TODO add the actual terminal velocity the payload achieved

\begin{figure}
\begin{centering}
\includegraphics{./graphs/parachute-derivative}
\par\end{centering}
\caption{Position-time graph showing terminal velocity of TARC-16 parachute and dummy payload.}
\label{fig:parachute-derivative}
\end{figure}

The outside of the parachute was painted in phosphorescent paint; This increased the visibility of the payload on the ground during a night search, providing a secondary method for locating it after descent as per requirement \ref{req:redundant_location} of the High Altitude Challenge.
