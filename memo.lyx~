Project Codename
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
The Project CODENAME payload is equipped to collect internal and external
 temperature and pressure data, location, accelerometer and humidity measurement
s as well as photographs at short intervals for the duration of the balloon
 flight.
 This data will be written to a MicroSD Card which can be read upon retrieval
 of the capsule, and all information except for live video will also be
 transmitted in real-time to a ground station via APRS.
 The Project CODENAME payload is equipped with a secondary GPS (and transmitter)
 that runs on a separate power source to ensure location redundancy.
 The projected weight for the payload is 210 grams, and the projected price
 is less than $750.
 Maximum battery life of the payload operating at maximum expenditure (Bluetooth
 and GPS included) is approximately 22 hours.

Hardware
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The payload will be run by a chipset taken from a Samsung Galaxy s4.
 A version of this chipset* has already been acquired by Project Codename,
 and tested extensively.

Software
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Project CODENAME team has already written and tested a comprehensive
 operational script for the payload.
 By serializing all data sent by APRS, the payload is able to transmit 2
 times the amount of data of typical APRS systems, with less power consumption.
 The program is also written and run natively on the chipset, reducing power
 consumption even further.
 A program to quickly deserialize the data has also been constructed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Part*
Ground Station
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Project CODENAME has two independent methods for predicting weather patterns
 and ballon flight path, both of which have been proven effective in the
 field.
 The team also has direct ties to the Office of Congresswoman Kristi Noem,
 which is expected to simplify negotiations with the FAA tremendously.
