VR Weather Particles
========

A relatively simple (yet still quite pretty) demo of glowing particles floating around your head. These particles move and change colour in response to the weather in various locations around the globe.

If you make something super wonderous and potentially more dizzying from this basic code, please do let me know! I'm on Twitter at @thatpatrickguy, or you can find me at [Dev Diner](http://www.devdiner.com) (http://www.devdiner.com). I'd love to have a look!

Keen for more of this sort of thing? This demo is part of an article at http://www.sitepoint.com. I also write all about emerging tech over at [Dev Diner](http://www.devdiner.com) (https://www.devdiner.com)!
